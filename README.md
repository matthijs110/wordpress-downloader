This project is a work in progress. It does work, but needs some improvements.

## Todo
- [ ] Code improvements
- [ ] Optional argument to specify the WordPress version
- [ ] Error handling (show stack trace)
- [ ] Show [progress bar](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/helpers/progressbar.html) for each process (not sure if this is possible)
